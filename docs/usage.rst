Setting up users
================

   As of Stork 0.1.0 release, there is no possibility to create new users. This
   functionality will be added in the next release. Currently, the default
   administrator's account is created and can be used to sign in to the
   system via the web UI. Please use the login `admin` and password `admin` to
   sign in to the system.


Monitoring machines with BIND and Kea
=====================================
