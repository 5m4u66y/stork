# stork

Stork is a new project started by ISC in October 2019 with the aim of delivering
BIND and Kea dashboard. It is going to be a spiritual successor of earlier
attempts - Kittiwake and Antherius.

It is currently in very early stages of planning. More information will become publicly
available in October 2019. Stay tuned!

# Getting Started

Please see the Installation section in the Stork ARM for details. Stork ARM will
be published soon, but for the time being you can generate it on your own by
doing this:

```consol
rake docs
```

Make sure you have rake and sphinx installed.

# Build instructions

The easiest way to run Stork is with docker (`rake docker_up`). However, it is
possible to run Stork without docker. See Installation section of the Stork ARM.
