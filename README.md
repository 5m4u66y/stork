# stork

Stork is a new project started by ISC in October 2019 with the aim of delivering
BIND and Kea dashboard. It is going to be a spiritual successor of earlier
attempts - Kittiwake and Antherius.

It is currently in very early stages of development.

For details, please see [Stork Administrator Reference Manual](https://stork.readthedocs.io).

# Build instructions

The easiest way to run Stork is with docker (`rake docker_up`). However, it is
possible to run Stork without docker. See Installation section of the Stork ARM.
