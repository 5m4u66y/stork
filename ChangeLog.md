LEGEND
[bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
        unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	    compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func]  new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	    change, which would require a bump of major version.
[sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	    fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	    security patch releases.
[perf]  Performance related change.

*: Backward incompatible or operational change.
