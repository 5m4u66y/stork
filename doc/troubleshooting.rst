Stork Agent
===========

There are described the solutions for some popular issues with the Stork Agent.

--------------

:Issue:       The machine is authorized in the Stork Server and shows no error, but has no application.
:Description: User installed and ran the Stork Server and next the Stork Agent.
              Next, it authorized the machine. Some time has passed, on the "Machines"
              page the "Last Refreshed" column value is actual and "Error" column value
              is empty, but "Daemons" colum is still blank. The "Application" section
              on the specific machine page is empty too.
:Solution:    Check that:
              - Kea Conrol Agent, Kea DHCP4, and/or Kea DHCP6
              - BIND9
              daemons are running.
:Explanation: If the "Last Refreshed" column value is actual and the "Error" column value
              has no error then the communication between Stork Server
              and Stork Agent works correctly. It means that the cause of the problem
              is between the Stork Agent and the daemons. But the Stork Agent doesn't report
              any connection problem. Probably none of the Kea/BIND9 daemons are running.
              BIND9 daemon communicates with Stork Agent directly. Kea DHCP4 and Kea DHCP6
              connect via Kea Control Agent. If you see in the Stork UI only "CA" daemon
              then it means that the Kea Control Agent is running, but the DHCP daemons aren't.

--------------

:Issue:       After start the Stork Agent stucks in infinite "sleeping" loop
:Description: The Stork Agent is running with the server support (the `--listen-prometheus-only`
              flag isn't used). On the `try to register agent in Stork server` message in the standard output
              follows only the infinite loop of the `sleeping for 10 seconds before next registration
              attempt` messages.
:Solution:    The Stork Server isn't running. First start the server service and next the Stork Agent daemon.

--------------

:Issue:       After start the agent falls into infinite loop of messages: "loaded server cert:
              /var/lib/stork-agent/certs/cert.pem and key: /var/lib/stork-agent/certs/key.pem"
:Description: The Stork Agens runs correctly and the registration passed. But after the
              "started serving Stork Agent" message the agent constantly, in 1 second interval,
              returns one message on standard output about loading server certs. The network
              traffic shows that the server rejects all packets from the agent (TLS HELLO handshake failed).
:Solution:    Re-register the agent to regenerate the certificates. You can use ``stork-agent register`` command. 
:Explanation: The /var/lib/stork-agent/certs/ca.pem file is missing or corrupted. The re-registration
              removes old files and creates new ones.


--------------

:Issue:       The agent doesnt started, but displays ``open /var/lib/stork-agent/certs/cert.pem: no such file or directory
              could not load cert PEM file: /var/lib/stork-agent/certs/cert.pem`` error message.
:Solution:    Re-register the agent to regenerate the certificates. You can use ``stork-agent register`` command.             

--------------
:Issue:       The agent prints on stdout the message ``problem with connecting to dhcp daemon: unable to forward command to
              the dhcp6 service: No such file or directory. The server is likely to be offline ``
:Solution:    Try to call ``systemctl start kea-dhcp4 kea-dhcp6``
:Explanation: The ``kea-dhcp4.service`` or ``kea-dhcp6.serive`` (depending on the service type in the message) is not running.
              If above commands don't resolve the problems then see the Kea ARM for the troubleshooting.
--------------

:Issue:       The Stork Agent receives the "remote error: tls: certificate required" message from the Kea Control Agent.
:Description: The Stork Agent and the Kea Control Agent are running, but these daemons cannot establish the connection.
              The standard output of the Strok Agent contains the errors with above message.
:Solution:    Install the valid TLS certificates in the Stork Agent or set "cert-required" value in ``/etc/kea/kea-ctrl-agent.conf`` to "false".
:Explanation: By default, the Stork Agent uses no certificates (standalone mode) or self-signed certificates (generated by
              the Stork Server). If the Kea Control Agent has set "cert-required" value to "true" then it requires
              that the Stork Agent will use HTTPS connections with valid, trusted TLS certificates.
              You can disable this option when you use the self-signed certificates or replace the Stork Agent
              TLS credentials with the trusted ones.
