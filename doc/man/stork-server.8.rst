Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``stork-server`` provides the main Stork server capabilities. In
every stork deployment, there should be exactly one stork-server.

Mailing List and Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a public mailing list available for the Stork project. **stork-dev**

contributors, and other advanced users. The list is available at
https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort support
on both of those lists.

Once stork will become more mature, ISC will be providing professional support
for Stork services.
