        <p>This page displays configuration of the review checkers.</p>
        <p>
            Stork can detect and report potential issues with the monitored servers' configurations. The generated
            reports contain detailed descriptions and suggestions to eliminate the most typical errors and
            misconfigurations. Each report is generated by a dedicated "checker" validating some particular
            configuration aspect. Checkers have unique names displayed with the reports, so it is easy to identify which
            checker generated it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If some configuration reports are not relevant in the particular deployment, they can be disabled globally
            or for selected daemons. In this case, the respective checkers are not run, improving the clarity of the
            reports list and the review performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the list of checkers on this page to disable or enable them globally (i.e., for all daemons). This
            choice can be overridden for individual daemons on the daemon page - configuration review section.
